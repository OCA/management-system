Extends the Nonconformity form so it can also represent NC candidates and other
types of feedback, such as complaints, measurements, suggestions, etc.

The "type" field identifies if the feedback corresponds to a nonconformity, or
to other type of record, such as "best practice", "suggestion", etc.

This module purpose overlaps with "mgmtsystem_claim" module, so you should use
either one or the other.
It will fit best to your uses cases requiring:
  * a common numbering sequence for complaints and nonconformities;
  * a single point-of-entry for all management system related occurrences.
