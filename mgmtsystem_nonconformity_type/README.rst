This module add classification for the Nonconformity of Management System module.

Nonconformity (NC)

- Type: add a field to classify a NC in Internal, Partner, Customer, External.
    * Internal: when the NC is due and revealed in an internal process
    * Partner:  when the NC is due to a Partner
    * Customer: when the NC si due and connected to a claim of the Customer
    * External: when the NC si due and connected to a claim of an External entity (e.g. an Authority)

- For the Partner NC type add a button to send an email to the Partner associated with the Nonconformity: for this mgmtsystem_nonconformity_partner has to be installed and a Partner's Contact of type Quality has to be set

- Quantity checked (qty-ck) and not compliant (qty-nc): a check is performed on the quantity to ensure that qty-nc isn't greater than qty-ck and in case perform an auto-set.
